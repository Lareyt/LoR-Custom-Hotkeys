# LoR-Custom-Hotkeys
AutoHotkey script for Legends of Runeterra to add a hotkey for the Oracle's Eye as well as mapping existing hotkeys to mouse buttons.

This requires AutoHotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/) to work.

The following hotkeys are currently available:
  - Tab or Middle Mouse Button: Activate Oracle's Eye (battle preview)
  - Mouse Button 4: Space (big button)
  - Mouse Button 5: A (attack / retreat all)
